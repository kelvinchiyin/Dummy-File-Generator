Dummy File Generator for docx, pptx, xlsx, pdf, jpg

I tried to find a way to generate dummy/sample file with accurate target size, but I cannot find one. So I try to build one myself:). The file for docx, pptx, xlsx will be show as corrupted/need to be repair. Just click repair/trust the source. It is caused by my implementation in function padToExactSize(). Feel free to create pull request if any solution can handle it better.
